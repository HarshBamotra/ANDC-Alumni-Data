# React Workflow Cheatsheet

```
I'm assuming you've cloned the project and made your branch, 
and you've installed node.js
```

## 1. First install the react-script

open the terminal/cmd and write the following command

```
npm install react-scripts
```

## 2. open the project

open the directory(folder) in which your code is stored

1. you can go to the folder in file explorer 
2. right click or shift + right-click
3. choose the option open in terminal/command prompt/powershell

or you can just cd into that folder

## 3. open live server

you can edit the code but if you wish to see the changes as you make them
run the code - 

```
npm start
```

this will start a live server in your local network, which will open in your browser

> note that the server will close when you close the terminal or terminate the process with ctrl+c in case of terminals and powershell

in case it doesn't open, 
go to your browser and search 

```
localhost:3000
```

> your local host address can be different, look it up in the terminal

## 4. Responsive view

if you want to view your site in a vertical screen like you mobile

just open your browser in your device say your mobile, and search 


```
(your-ip-address):3000
```
> to get your ip address run ipconfig command in terminal
